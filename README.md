# Estimation of Winterwheat Aboveground Biomass using Sentinel-2 imagery and Random Forest Algorithm

## 1. Introduction
Crop biomass is a globally important climate-relevant terrestrial carbon pool and its monitoring important for weed, pest and soil erosion control, as well as for nutrient cycling, overall soil health and crop productivity improvement. Crop yield is the marketable fraction of above ground biomass accumulated over a growing season, which varies widely over space and time, because of differences in cultivars, environmental conditions, and agronomic practices. In the agricultural sector there is a growing interest in using remotely sensed imagery to estimate crop biomass. Satelliet data delivers consistent and frequent information for crop yield estimation over large areas. Crop models typically account for the cummulative effect of these three factors and other geospatial information. Satellite image data are an important input to the models because the capture eco-physical conditions on the ground consistently and frequently and they offer the possibility to do so over large areas. Machine learning methods liek random forest are increasingly employed for crop modelling because of the challenges of process-based methods to account for the complex interactions governing crop biomass
